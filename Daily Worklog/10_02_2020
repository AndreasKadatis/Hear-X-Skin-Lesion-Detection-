Today is gonna be the last day i spend trying to get the ensemble model working using deepstack. Ill try to work through the
sciklearn library, as this is where the error is, but if im not able to solve the issue then so be it. Ill then move on to trying
a different technique. Also ill be starting the formal write up of the handover document i want to give hearx. Ive completed 
the architecture of the report, its just a question of writing it all up now. [1 hour]
