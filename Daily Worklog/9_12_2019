Started by running through the model module after finishing the preprocessing of the HAM dataset on the weekend. Encountered some
interesting bugs and errors, some of which I will have to take up with Jaco im afraid as i dont know how to solve them. For one, the 
codebase im using is not compatible with the Tensorflow 2.0 version that hearx has been using. It is therefore throwing up errors 
that i do not know how to rectify, and after exploring online forums for answers, the only solutions ive found are to revert back
to an older version of Tensorflow or Rewrite the style of the code. As i am not comfortable with doing the latter, i did the former,
eliminating the errors, but then realised my runtime is exceedingly slow, 1 hour per epoch. Knowing that there are 30 epochs (
model run throughs) i checked the GPU and it seems it was running virtually the same speed as the CPU, as i was running tensorflow
1.3 not 2. This will have to be discussed with Jaco. [2 hours]

Reinstalled Keras latest version and got rid of previously outlined error, however now everytime i run the sequence the entire 
virtual enviroment crashes. [1 hour]
