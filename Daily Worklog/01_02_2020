Im currently working through this example/tutorial in detail [https://machinelearningmastery.com/stacking-ensemble-for-deep-
learning-neural-networks/], trying to figure out how to apply the same technique to our mobilnet case. Its slow going as once
again my limitations in python need to be overcome, but is much better than in the beginning of this project. Im also running
more rounds per epoch with the standard model, instead of the shortened version i used for testing different models. [3.5 hours]
