Today is going to be the first day of the last tw weeks of my work with Hearx. I have been unable to work full days for the last
week and a half due to prior commitments, howver am now free to work full time again till the end of my internship. I will be work-
ing 10-11 hours a day for the next three days and then normal workdays this weekend, and then a normal work week next week to finish
and accumulate the requisite hours. The goal for today is to try a last couple of new techniques to get the validation accuracy of 
of the model higher. I've already started looking at the new layers that i want to add in conjuction with stronger L2 regularization.
Augmentation at this point is second priority, as the evidence seems that it might not be as effective as other potential 
methods. [1.5 hours]
