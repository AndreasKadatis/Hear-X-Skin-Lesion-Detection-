Today is going to be the first day of the last tw weeks of my work with Hearx. I have been unable to work full days for the last
week and a half due to prior commitments, howver am now free to work full time again till the end of my internship. I will be work-
ing 10-11 hours a day for the next three days and then normal workdays this weekend, and then a normal work week next week to finish
and accumulate the requisite hours. The goal for today is to try a last couple of new techniques to get the validation accuracy of 
of the model higher. I've already started looking at the new layers that i want to add in conjuction with stronger L2 regularization.
Augmentation at this point is second priority, as the evidence seems that it might not be as effective as other potential 
methods. [1.5 hours] 

After looking at L2 regularization code examples, and again at how i implemented the layered augmentation i decided there might be
more value persuing better data augmentation vs regularization, as i dont think my attemt before was as good as i thought it was.
Ive made a few changes and added some additional class weights to see if i can make it better, and have it training now in the back-
ground. Ive also stumbled across an interesting way of using the ImageDataGenerator function, while also making use of python
inbuilt over-fitting functions, [https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-apply-data-augmentation-to-deal-with-unbalanced-datasets
-in-20-lines-of-code-ada8521320c9] and will now work on bringing it in on a third version of the Mobilnet approach. [2 hours]

The third run of the previous augmentation method previously mentioned (after making several changes) produced no substantial 
improvement, still level at 84% validation accuracy. Also after trying to get this example working in my code [https://medium
.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-apply-data-augmentation-to-deal-with-unbalanced-datasets-in-20-lines-of-code-ada8521320c9] i realised
that it follows a completely different way of loading the images into the model and training it. After reading up on the different
loading methods for images, i realised once again just how inexperienced i am with the detail of python and its associated libraries.
It will take quite a while (at least a couple of hours) for me to figure out a way to get the images into a format that would
work, and i am still not 100% sure it would work. I am therefore unsure if i should continue down this path. What i might do,
is explore other options more applicable to what ive done, and ask Jaco for advice with regards to this method. [2.5 hours]
