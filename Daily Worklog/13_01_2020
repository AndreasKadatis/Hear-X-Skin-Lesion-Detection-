First day back after the new year break, will seek to pick up where i left off last month. Spent the morning getting myself
aquainted again with the work that i had just done in Dec, namely the pre-processing/image augmentation, and what my agenda 
will be over the next 4 weeks. I think i will start looking at the different keras models appropriate to this task, and seek
to start laying out the framework for the input-output framework me and Jaco discussed last month. [2 hours]
