First day back after the new year break, will seek to pick up where i left off last month. Spent the morning getting myself
aquainted again with the work that i had just done in Dec, namely the pre-processing/image augmentation, and what my agenda 
will be over the next 4 weeks. I think i will start looking at the different keras models appropriate to this task, and seek
to start laying out the framework for the input-output framework me and Jaco discussed last month. [2 hours] 

Worked through the VGG19 model with the idea of it being the next structure to implement and compare to mobilenet. Firts thing
was to understand the adjustments that were made to Mobilenet in the initial implementation, namley the elimination of the 
last 6 layers and the freezing of the last 23. Now i will discuss with Jaco my queries regarding these adjsutments and have now
done something silimiair to VGG. It is currently training so it will be interesting to see the results. Problem is i am not fam-
iliar with the reasoning behind these adjustments so i might do some further research into why these decisions were made, working
off the prelim results from the first run (done without rea understanding) that will give a good impression of the overall robust-
ness of the model. [2 hours]
