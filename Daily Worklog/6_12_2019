While waiting for the rrest of the HAM Dataset to upload onto google drive I started looking through the actual model code with
the eventual modification to another CNN, such as Resnet or VGG, in mind. I since worked through the Keras documentation on both
Mobilenet and VGG (my first CNN that i will try out, specifically VGG16) and have a couple of questions regarding how i will modify 
the code to be able to accomodate both. I will raise my concerns with Jaco if i am not able to resolve them during my testing phase
which will start once the HAM datasets are finished migrating. [2 hours]

Today was a very frustrating day. The upload of the HAM dataset part 2 took 8 hours. My linux PC extracts a zip file instantly, 
including both HAM datasets when I downloaded them initially when I was working through Anaconda Jupyter. Unfortunatly i made the 
mistake of assuming that Google drive was capable of the same thing and the combination of first uploading the zip file, and then
trying to extract it there, took the whole day. Hopefully ill be able to work on this further tonight but if im not able to get 
results ill have to finish it over the weekend. 

HAM data-set is finally up and was able to do some runs but wont be able to finish up today. Ill be trying to finish up my goals 
for this week (replicating the model results and then modifying the model accordingly) on the weekend, hopefully everything will 
run smoothly again now that the cloud is completely set-up. [1.5 hours]
