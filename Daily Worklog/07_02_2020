 Read through the new pipeline documentation again and i still cannot see why this isnt working. Model.fit function should be sup-
 porting generators. Im going to move on to at least getting the ensemble model functioning. [1 hour]
 
Working through the deepstack documentation properly i want to make sure what it is exactly that i am using, not just some vague
idea of a python library. Im also working through other examples using deepstack, but so far i dont understand what the code in my 
notebook is complaining about. [1 hour]
