 Read through the new pipeline documentation again and i still cannot see why this isnt working. Model.fit function should be sup-
 porting generators. Im going to move on to at least getting the ensemble model functioning. [1 hour]
 
Working through the deepstack documentation properly i want to make sure what it is exactly that i am using, not just some vague
idea of a python library. Im also working through other examples using deepstack, but so far i dont understand what the code in my 
notebook is complaining about. [1 hour]

Until about half an hour ago no GPU was available for me to backend on, so ive just been working through the deepstack material
but there is unfortunately not that much to work through. The code should be very basic in terms of importing over the keras model
into a stacked case. Hopefully once the model finishes training i will be able to get started on trying to just brute force
get it to work by trawling stack overflow and other forums to gete it functioning, something ive avoided doing till now. [2 hours]

Alright so once the model finished training, and i was able to start trawling forums, i realised just how few cases there are of 
people using deepstack with regards to keras model building. I therefore had to resort to working line by line through the source
code for the library at [https://github.com/jcborges/DeepStack/tree/master/deepstack]. After working testing each function with
its respective paramter, i finally realised why i was receiving a Nonetype error, i hadnt included the validation sets into the 
model_1/2/3 declarations (beucase the few online resources i could fine did not specify that that was the case). Once i did that
the error dissapeared but another came up that i havent so far put enough time into to debug. It took me a very long time to figure
out the last problem so ill look at this one again next week. [3.5 hours]
