 Read through the new pipeline documentation again and i still cannot see why this isnt working. Model.fit function should be sup-
 porting generators. Im going to move on to at least getting the ensemble model functioning. [1 hour]
 
Working through the deepstack documentation properly i want to make sure what it is exactly that i am using, not just some vague
idea of a python library. Im also working through other examples using deepstack, but so far i dont understand what the code in my 
notebook is complaining about. [1 hour]

Until about half an hour ago no GPU was available for me to backend on, so ive just been working through the deepstack material
but there is unfortunately not that much to work through. The code should be very basic in terms of importing over the keras model
into a stacked case. Hopefully once the model finishes training i will be able to get started on trying to just brute force
get it to work by trawling stack overflow and other forums to gete it functioning, something ive avoided doing till now. [2 hours]
