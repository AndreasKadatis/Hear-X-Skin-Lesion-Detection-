Today was purely understanding what Keras related installations were needed, and getting the related python libraries installed 
alongside the associated Keras packages needed to build the Alexnet architecture (which i will be beginning with). I therefore 
installed the following libraries [5 hours]:

1. Python 3
2. OpenBLAS
3. NumPy
4. SciPy
5. matplotlib
6. HDF5
7. Graphviz
8. pydot-ng
9. OpenCV
10. Tensorflow
11. Keras

Please see: [https://github.com/hsekia/learning-keras/wiki/How-to-install-Keras-to-Ubuntu-18.04] for the isntallation process followed

I then attempted to start building the Alexnet architecture of various online documentation, however there were problems with my 
python installation that was causing issues. I rectified some of them, but am still struggling linking the correct kernels to my 
script editor. I have been trying to use Jupyter but doesnt seem to be running off the correct kernel, however  the actual python
installation seems to be working correctly now. [3 hours]
