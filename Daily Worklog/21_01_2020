Feedback from Jaco was positive on the Mobilenet results, although he raised a noticable issue in the discrepancy between the 
validation accuracy and the training accuracy (around 20%). He outlined two main methods, a dropout layer and L1/L2 regularization.
There is already a Dropout layer in the existing structure, so what i am going to do is focus on data augmentation, ie get the train-
ing set larger, and then also include the regularization methods. I spent today working through the resources Jaco sent through as
well as looking how to include it into the existing model. An issue that occurred to me today is what end accuracy is feasable
for us? The average model from the HAMdataset competion was around 80%, but to get better will not be easy, and i doubt my skill
level is enough to get us there. I might raise this with Jaco, and see what their expectations are, and also organise a skype 
meeting with him next week.[3 hours]
