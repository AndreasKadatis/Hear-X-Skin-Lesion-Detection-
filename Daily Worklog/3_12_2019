Worked through more CNN tutorials and resources, have a pretty good grip now of the fundementals behind Convolutional neural networks,
their hidden layers, the effect of max-pooling and fully connected layers.will seek to start learning how to train the Alexnet archi-
tecture using the CIFAR-10 database. [1.5 hours] I am aware that Alexnet at this point is not the most optimal deep learning network, 
however I am getting the impression that it provided the base for the higher performing Resnet and GoogLeNet architectures that I  
want to work towards.
