Worked through more CNN tutorials and resources, have a pretty good grip now of the fundementals behind Convolutional neural networks,
their hidden layers, the effect of max-pooling and fully connected layers.will seek to start learning how to train the Alexnet archi-
tecture using the CIFAR-10 database. [1.5 hours] I am aware that Alexnet at this point is not the most optimal deep learning network, 
however I am getting the impression that it provided the base for the higher performing Resnet and GoogLeNet architectures that I  
want to work towards. 

I am struggling to understand the data pipeline construction that feeds into the Alexnet architecture. I am going to work through
an application of it from an online resource to better understand the implementation. 

Working through a lab with regards to image identification and labelling (can be found here: https://github.com/securetorobert/
dog_breeds_alexnet/blob/master/Dog_Breeds_AlexNet.ipynb) and working through each line of code, my understanding of building the 
data pipeline is much better, however, there were a multitude of errors and adjustments i had to make to be able to accomodate for 
differing tensorflow installations, and in the end the model failed to fit to the training data set provided. I expect this problem
to come up in the future as well, so will need to accomodate for it. [4 hours] 

General admin [includes emails]. [1 hour]

Talked to Jaco, discussed starting points this week, as well as discussed my current software installations. Reinstalled my current
tensorflow installations, adding GPU support, did some testing to confirm the installation and started working through some of the
Tensorflow GPU modules discussed. (1.5 hours)
