Started by finishing up the preprocessing modules and making sure the data is properly accessed. [1 hour]

I then started with the implementation of the model itself. Until this point i had been using Jupyters notebook and Spyder3 through
Anaconda, assuming that I had installed the proper software to make use of my on board Nvidia GTX GPU. After running some of the 
tests in the main model file, I realized that it was not seeing any GPU on my system. After running some other diagnostics, and 
working through some online workthroughs to look at installing the proper Nvidia-Ubuntu drivers but none of those seem to have 
worked. I will therefore have to move to using Google Colab (something ive wanted to avoid since i have an onboard gpu and enjoy 
using Anaconda) in order to get access to a GPU processing unit. [2.5 hours]

Ok so i tried working through the link Jaco sent through: 
{https://medium.com/deep-learning-turkey/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-e113627b9f5d} to try and set up Colab, but for some reason 
Colaboratory will not show up on any of my drive menus, even tho it says its connected (what ever that means). No online forums seem
to provide any solutions so after a while i will just have to work through the Colab website directly (i do not understand what the
difference is, but i will never the less raise the issue with Jaco in our next correspondence). [1 hour]

Had to reinstall several libraries and move over the data into the new CoLab workstation, while also cleaning up and organizing my 
google drive (which i will now be using much more frequently) for the rest of this project. [1 hour]

Transferring the Image data over to Colab took a long time, while running through the code i transferred over did not take too
long i was unfortunately hampered by the upload. Instead i started building the actual model code in preperation for 
tomorrow. [2 hours]
