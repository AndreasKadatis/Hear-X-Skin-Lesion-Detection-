Still struggled with the kernel issue (my python installations are not properly lined up) but did eventually reinstall the 
libraries through Anaconda which now seems to be working, will now proceed with building Alexnet architecture. [1 hour]

Worked through the Alexnet Coding structure, trying to understand the key principles between the different conv-
olutional structures/layers. [1 hour]

Wrote the Alexnet base script and did some preliminary runs, seemded to run well with some "deprcation" warnings issued, 
will look into using more supported function calls once i understand the program better. [1 hour]

The aim for this week is to get (at least) the Alexnet architecture running with training datasets from the CIFAR-10 database.
Spent the rest of today looking at starting to do this, setting up prospective inputs (image examples) and what classifications
will be sought to be inputted. Its important to establish what the input-output parameters need to be, as i am not familiar with the 
internal filters and architecture. [2 hours]
