Worked through the GPU testing modules that Jaco sent through, after running the tests, and sorting through the various errors 
involved, the calculation speeds indicate my new processing time through the Tensorflow GPU is 20x faster. [1 hour]

Worked through online materials on Transfer Learning in preperatation for the model buidling tutorials on skin lesion 
detection.[1.5 hours]

Explored the fopensource data and associated Kaggle kernels, relating to the Skin lesion CNN task found here 
{https://towardsdatascience.com/classifying-skin-lesions-with-convolutional-neural-networks-fc1302c60d54}, will now begin to 
program this task in earnest. [1 hour]

First importing and setting up the data files that the model will want to use and getting the pre-processing scripts to work. I
will be fetching all the base code from {https://github.com/aryanmisra/Skin-Lesion-Classifier/}. Initial testing looking at using 
the HAM-10000 dataset seemed to be fine, in terms of the preporcessing into Imagenet format (224*224*3 etc), I decided to make sure
I understood the Architecture of mobile nets' network, especailly before running the code, trying to replicate their 80% accuracy,
and then trying to modify the code using a different CNN. [2.5 hours]

Worked through material relating to mobile-net architecture, which helped clear up some of the questions I had regarding parts on the
previously mentioned base code repository. Filled in the rest of the code and will start running and testing out different models
tomorrow. [2 hours]
