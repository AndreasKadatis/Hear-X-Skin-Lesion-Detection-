After having family commitments on friday and saturday ill be working today instead. After receiving great feedback from Jaco
with regards to what i worked on last week, he reccomended firstly to make sure all references to tensorflow.keras is the same 
not mixed with just keras callbacks, and that i start using tf 2.1. He also pointd out that i have not been making use of the 
class_weight method in order to even out the data set and get it more balanced. After figuring out how to write it into the stan-
dard model, and resolving a couple of issues, i set the VGG model to run and so far it seems to be reaching higher accuracies 
faster than before, but will difinitevly know at the end. I then started porting over the Mobilenet model from last year over, 
however it seems to be having errors that VGG and Resnet did not have. I am currently trying to resolve them while the VGG model
is training. [3 hours]

I resolved the issues with Mobilenent and let it run through its round of training, while the results from VGG seemed to indicate
a small improvement over the previous run presented to Jaco. The mobilenet however acheived 99% accuracy in the training and high-
er accuracies with the other models when tested using the test data. It was alos by far the fastest. This was to be expected, 
Mobilenet was designed for fast image processing on smaller mobile devices, hence why we started of with that one. What is also
great is that compared to last year it is a huge improvement. Unfortunately the fix i used did not work in the Inceptionnet model
so far so i am still trying to resolve this error. [2.5 hours]
