Started today with beginning to write the script for the ENsemble model. While it looks relatively straightforward using the
deepstack library, it required some adjustments and decisions when proting over from the tandard model. Once the genreal archi-
tecture was decided upon, i had to decide which models to use as submodels. For the sake of simply getting the model functional 
im currently training 3 differnet versions of the standard model, using different weights from the most succesful trains from
last week. I will also use a seperate training dataset for each model, generated using ImageDataGenerator, as discussed last 
week. The first two models are almost done training and the first version of the Ensemble model is currently ready for the sub-
model input. [3.5 hours]

While the models were training i was working on the technical report that i assume Hearx will want at the end of my internship 
with them. Basically a manual, documentating what ive done, the general theory behind the different models, and fully referenced
with all the online resources i used throughout. Once the models were done training, i tried running my ensmeble script but ran 
into some issues. I am apparently not saving the models correctly, and it couldnt retrieve them. Tomorrow i'll have to look into
this, but Jaco sent a reply to what i sent him last week and raised some suggestions/issues that ill also need to be rectified.
Ill first try and solve the ensemble issue and then look into what Jaco wants help with, mainly the data pipline for the model.
This is encouraging as i noticed through working through many resources and examples that the way we were doing things seemed 
to not be the norm. [4 hours]
