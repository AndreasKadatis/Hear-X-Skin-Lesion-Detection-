Started today with beginning to write the script for the ENsemble model. While it looks relatively straightforward using the
deepstack library, it required some adjustments and decisions when proting over from the tandard model. Once the genreal archi-
tecture was decided upon, i had to decide which models to use as submodels. For the sake of simply getting the model functional 
im currently training 3 differnet versions of the standard model, using different weights from the most succesful trains from
last week. I will also use a seperate training dataset for each model, generated using ImageDataGenerator, as discussed last 
week. The first two models are almost done training and the first version of the Ensemble model is currently ready for the sub-
model input. [3.5 hours]
