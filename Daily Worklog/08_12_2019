Finally started to run the pre-processing module, sorted out bugs and various errors while letting the module sort through
the training and validation data set and letting it copy over the files to their respective locations. Everything seems to have
gone correctly and so with the pre-processing sorted now, hopefully, i can start figuring out the training of the actual 
model. [4 hours]
