Worked through the confusion matrix documentation, while having the model run in the background, retraining at a slower rate,
i suspect because it is earlier in the day with more traffic on the network. [1 hour]

After the model finished training, i started to try once again to fix the confusion_matrix issue, however after trying several
things mentioned in the tensorflow documentation, i looked through the source code repository and found that i had missed a single 
variable statement which was causing the issues. Once corrected it produced the imbalanced data mentioned by Jaco. Ill now move on
to researching how to combat these imbalances followoing the advice provided yesterday. [1.5 hours]
