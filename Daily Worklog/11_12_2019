Worked through the confusion matrix documentation, while having the model run in the background, retraining at a slower rate,
i suspect because it is earlier in the day with more traffic on the network. [1 hour]

After the model finished training, i started to try once again to fix the confusion_matrix issue, however after trying several
things mentioned in the tensorflow documentation, i looked through the source code repository and found that i had missed a single 
variable statement which was causing the issues. Once corrected it produced the imbalanced data mentioned by Jaco. Ill now move on
to researching how to combat these imbalances followoing the advice provided yesterday. [1.5 hours]

While researching the different assesment methods for image classifiers i became curious as to how much better the model would 
with the augmented image base. I therefore began training the previous augmented model notebook, with the changes to the generators
reverting back to their original state but keeping the new tensorflow implmentation. While this was running i worked through all
the most common evaluation methods for image classification as set out by iSIC 2019 guidelines, while noting down the aspects most
relevant to our case. I then started working through the fast.ai team results, who also based their model off of the same code
i have been working on till now. [2.5 hours]
