Ive begun the process of changing the images base for the training of the model. With the Mobilenet i first performed extensive pre-
processing to segregate the iamges into different folders etc. With this resnet model, [https://www.kaggle.com/elvinj1203/resnet50-84-test-acc]
, they are able to achieve 85% accuracy (is the claim), without the extensive augmentation performed by the previous architecture.
What im gonna do is first see if their results are replicable, and if this is the case, see if i can match their results with the
same mobilenet model. Issue is that transferring the files over into the format requested by the code is taking very long. [4 hours]
