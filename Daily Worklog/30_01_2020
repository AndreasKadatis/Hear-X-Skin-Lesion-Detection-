Ive committed today to just working on the model itself and not augmentation. As much as i want to, i think it would be more 
more wise to seek better model methods. THe main problem with seeking better model methods is the fact that i am not familiar 
enough with knowing what layers to add and what hyperparameters to adjust to get the best results. I therefore spent time today
working through tutorials and material related to how to adress overfitting in a systematic way, and basically what it boils down
to is adjusting the hyperparameters, while following some broad guidelines of some clear "dont do's", and following a trial and 
error basis. So ive made some changes to the layers, and ive also increased the training dataset from 6000 to 8000, and am running 
two gpu's, running different sets of hyperparameters, and keeping a log of the results. One thing ive just noticed is that the 
model checkpointing is using val_loss as the standard for choosing the model to save. While this might make sense, i am after all
looking for improvements in val_accuracy, and looking back at the original Mobilenet model from before the Christmas break, they 
also used Val_accuracy as the metric for checkpointing. Ill look at this once the first couple of trains are through. [3 hours]
