Today i will try and finish up porting in the new pipelining module and getting it functional. So far once again i am not able
to get the .glob() function to recognize the images in my directory. im looking at other possible functions that might be able
toperform the same purpose. [1.5 hours]

Was a able to sort out the glob issue, but i had to resort to a slightly different technique than what Jaco uses. The outcome
is the same so regardless it should be working fine niw. That was just seperating the image labels from the actual image files,
i now have to get the dataset correctly formed so that i can input it into the model.fit module. I can see what Jaco wants to do
now however which is a good sign. [2.5 hours] 

Ive got a full new pipeline in the notebook and everything seems to be correct, but everytime i come to running model.fit the 
entire thing crashes and i have to restart my runtime. Evidently the model.fit isnt handling the new tf.data type correctly, either
that or Im not handling it correctly before i feed it in. Im must say im quite stumped as to what im doing wrong, if i cant come
figure out what im doing wrong tonight ill send through to Jaco what ive done and ask for advice. [2 hours]
