I wont be able to work full workdays this week, but will try to do at least 4 hours each day. Ive started to include in the 
.preprocessing modules of the Mobilenet model, as i assume it will be the focus for the next couple of weeks (considering its
much better performance vs the others). I am also reading through other materials on how to deal with biased datasets, as i 
will be implementing those methods next. [1 hour]

There was a small issue with the original run of the new Mobilenet model, but it was easily resolved and the new one is almost 
finished running. I also am running a third, at the same time (as google allows two GPU's so why not) to see what a second train-
ing produces. While resolving this i have done a lot of research into data bias and specifically, offline and online image aug-
mentation. This is something i learnt about briefly in my computer vision course, but never really ended up applying anywhere.
From what i was able to gather, in the original mobilenet implementation last year, we performed very heavy offline image 
augmentation, but evidently was not as effective using the other methods as the ones using this new structure. Once the new mobi-
lenet architecture is finished training ill send the results to Jaco as well as my thoughts on where to go with the image preprocessing
and augmentation. [3 hours]
