First i looked into the keras augmentation issue Jaco raised in his email. I think i might have misunderstood the use of the 
pre-process function. Ive emailed a response to Jaco, outlining my confusion. I also have started working through the pipelining
suggestions of Jaco. Basically i will have to change the entire way I load in the image data for processing, but the much faster 
training speeds suggested would be totally worth the change. Once i finish working through the material and are done running my
original standard models ill start including this into the code. After further looking into what i did wrong for the ensemble 
model in terms of loading in saved models i think ive fixed the issue and am waiting for the subodels to finish training so i can
look into wehther or not it will work now. I a not going to spend too much time on this, resto f today max, as i want to work rather
on the pipelining stuff Jaco indicated he wants me to work on rather. [4 hours]

The ensemble model is not working and im not sure why. I ended up installing the deepstack libraries and running the code from
my seperate ensemble model in one of my standard model notebook copies, and suddenly the model.load and model.save working work-
ing correctly. Problem with this was that i had run the other two models and assumed that i had saved them to my google drive, but
apparently it doesnt recognize them unless there were run in the same google notebook. I ended subbing in all three models as the
single one i had trained in that notebook, just to see if i could get the ensemble working, and at the end received an error when
i tried to see the accuracy results. I toyed around but wasnt able to get anything working in the end. Ill look at this again 
tomorrow, but if i cant find a solution ill have to move on to more productive work. [3.5 hours]
