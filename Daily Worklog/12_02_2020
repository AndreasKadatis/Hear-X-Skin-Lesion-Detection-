Finished my report and sent off my notebooks to Jaco and Herman. Hopefully they will be satisfied by my summary and my output
in general. This was a long internship, but it was incredibly learning and hopefully will equip me with skills that i will
use in the rest of my career. My thanks to HearX for all the advice and help theyve given me, as well as the oppurtunity to 
do this work for them. Cheers and best wishes. [7 hours]
