Today i will shift focus from the ensemble model to incorporating the new tf.data pipelining techniques into my existing standard
model. Today im running two notebooks, the ensemble model from yesterday (the that isnt working properly) and another mobilenet
model with some of the augmentation methods from the pre-processing module from last year. Im curious to see what difference this 
makes. Ive finished working through the tf.data documentation that Jaco sent through and have looked through the google notebook 
link Jaco sent as well. I think i see what he means, and will try and move in to my model these methods, but it may not be what he
had in mind. If i struggle ill let him know what i think. [3.5 hours]
