Today i will shift focus from the ensemble model to incorporating the new tf.data pipelining techniques into my existing standard
model. Today im running two notebooks, the ensemble model from yesterday (the that isnt working properly) and another mobilenet
model with some of the augmentation methods from the pre-processing module from last year. Im curious to see what difference this 
makes. Ive finished working through the tf.data documentation that Jaco sent through and have looked through the google notebook 
link Jaco sent as well. I think i see what he means, and will try and move in to my model these methods, but it may not be what he
had in mind. If i struggle ill let him know what i think. [3.5 hours]

After the two running models finished, the results of the one with the more gressive augmentation seemed to perform more poorly
than the other ones tested last week. Also i was not able to resolve the ensemble model errors, however i did not spend as much 
time as was needed as i wanted to move on to the pipeling material and getting the code from Jaco's notebook into my own. After 
working through the last of the tf.data material, and understanding what it was that Jaco was attempting with his notebook, i 
ported over the code but ran into some seemingly simple problems. Ill continue with this tomorrow but in the mean time ive emailed
jaco my confusions, and hopefully he will be able to provide some guidance. [4 hours]
