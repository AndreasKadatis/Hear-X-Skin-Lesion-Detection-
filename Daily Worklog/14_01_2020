Trying a diferent approach, i started research exclusively on the VGG method with conjuction to the methods involving freezing and
adding layers. After working through a couple online examples and tutorials on VGG and neural net adjustments with regards to transfer 
learning in general, i started re-writing the faulty structural code from yesterday. The challenge at the moment is not to get a 
VGG system working, but rather one that is part of a larger standardized notebook that can be used for the mobilenet architecture
previously, and any future models as well. If i was to just copy and paste code from other online implementations of the model
this would defeat the perpose. Therefore my largest obstacle at the moment, unfortunately, is my limited knowlege of tensorflow
and keras functions and applications, as well as my lack of proficiency with python. While much better than when i started with 
this project, it is taking time getting those proficiency levels up in all aspects. I will keep going further with this, as i feel
i am making progress in what i described above. [3.5 hours]
